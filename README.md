# Bomberman

A simple 2d game, remake of *Eric and the floaters*.
The game was made in C#, using the Monogame framework.

## Gameplay

You are the Eric. Your goal is to get through as many
levels as possible and get a high score. Each level is
randomly generated. Every map is a grid consisting of 
strong and weak walls. In every level, there are two
floating balloons (floaters). These are your enemies.
They are a bit faster than you, and can kill you.
You can also place bombs (only one at a time),
which explode after shortly after being placed. The explosion
is 5 x 5 blocks. The bomb can kill you, but you can also use
it to kill floaters. Killing a floater will earn you
a random amount of score between 160 and 1260.
